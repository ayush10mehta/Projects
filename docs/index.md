# Projects

## 1. Face-mask-detection

### Considering the covid-19 outbreak, I think this is best project that I can work as a Machine Learning enthusiast. Today everyone is aware of taking precaution and safety measures regarding covid-19, so face mask detection will play a huge role to avoid corona virus. 
### This project helps us to spread the awareness among people using face mask properly. It detects the face mask on your face whether the person is hiding his/her face by mask or not.

## 2. Handwritten-Digit-Recognization

### The handwritten digit recognition is the ability of computers to recognize human handwritten digits. It is a hard task for the machine because handwritten digits are not perfect and can be made in many different ways.
### The handwritten digit recognition is the solution to this problem which uses the image of a digit and recognizes the digit present in the image.
### To perform handwritten digit recognition, some basic knowledge on neural network and image processing is needed.

### CNN Architecture 
###The model’s architecture consists of three main parts, three convolutional blocks and four fully connected neural network layer.
###The inputs to this model are 28x28 images.
###We are using three convolutional layers with same configurations, using 64 (3x3) filters and ReLU as an activation function followed by max pooling layer of pool size of 2x2.
###The output of convolutional layer is flattened and sent to first fully connected layer of 64 neurons followed by 32 neurons layers and then to 10 neuron layer with softmax activation function which will give us our output.

## 3. Rice-Leaf-Deases-Detection

### In developing countries, farming land can be much larger and farmers cannot observe each and every plant, every day. Farmers are unaware of non-native diseases. 
### The model will help them in detecting which of the diseases the rice leaf has. 
### To perform Rice diseases prediction, some basic knowledge on neural network, CNN and image processing is needed.


### CNN Architecture 
### The model’s architecture consists of two main parts, five convolutional blocks and two fully connected neural network layer.
### The inputs to this model are 220x220 images.
### We are using five convolutional layers with one using 32 (3x3) filter, two using 64 (3x3) filter and the other two using 128 (3x3) filter and ReLU as an activation function followed by max pooling layer of pool and dropout.
### The output of convolutional layer is flattened and sent to first fully connected layer of 1024 neurons followed by ReLU activation, Batch Normalization and Dropout and then to 3 neuron layer with softmax activation function which will give us our output.
