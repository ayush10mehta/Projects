## 1. Face-mask-detection

### Considering the covid-19 outbreak, I think this is best project that I can work as a Machine Learning enthusiast. Today everyone is aware of taking precaution and safety measures regarding covid-19, so face mask detection will play a huge role to avoid corona virus. 
### This project helps us to spread the awareness among people using face mask properly. It detects the face mask on your face whether the person is hiding his/her face by mask or not.
