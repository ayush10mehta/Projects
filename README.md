# Projects

## 1. Face-mask-detection

### Considering the covid-19 outbreak, I think this is best project that I can work as a Machine Learning enthusiast. Today everyone is aware of taking precaution and safety measures regarding covid-19, so face mask detection will play a huge role to avoid corona virus. 
### This project helps us to spread the awareness among people using face mask properly. It detects the face mask on your face whether the person is hiding his/her face by mask or not.

## 2. Handwritten-Digit-Recognization

### The handwritten digit recognition is the ability of computers to recognize human handwritten digits. It is a hard task for the machine because handwritten digits are not perfect and can be made in many different ways.
### The handwritten digit recognition is the solution to this problem which uses the image of a digit and recognizes the digit present in the image.
### To perform handwritten digit recognition, some basic knowledge on neural network and image processing is needed.
